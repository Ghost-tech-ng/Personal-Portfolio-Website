# How to Add Your Profile Photo

To add your profile photo to the portfolio:

1. **Prepare your photo:**
   - Use a square image (recommended: 500x500px or larger)
   - Professional headshot works best
   - Save it as `profile.jpg`

2. **Add to the project:**
   - Copy your photo to: `c:\Users\hp\Documents\cv\portfolio-2026\public\profile.jpg`
   - The site will automatically display it in the About section

3. **If no photo is added:**
   - The site will show your initials "EO" as a fallback
   - Still looks professional!

The profile image appears in the About section with a cyan border and your name below it.
